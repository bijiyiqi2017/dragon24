# Dragon Fruit Delight: A Word Scramble Saga
 
![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)


Welcome to Dragon Fruit Delight, the web browser word scramble game brought to you by "The Dragon 24 Team"! But how did this project come to be?

It all started on the first day of the Chinese New Year 2024, Saturday, February 10, 2024, the Year of the Dragon, when three aspiring developers—George, Ruth, and William—crossed paths on the freeCodeCamp Discord server's #100daysofcode channel. United by their passion for coding, thirst for knowledge, and eagerness to collaborate, they quickly formed a bond.

As they embarked on their journey to become full-stack developers, they realized they shared more than just a love for coding. They shared an appreciation for challenges, creativity, and the sweet taste of victory after overcoming obstacles.

Inspired by the spirit of the dragon and the vibrant colors of the dragon fruit, they decided to channel their collective energy into creating a fun and engaging word scramble game. Thus, Dragon Fruit Delight was born—a project that not only showcases their technical skills but also reflects their shared interests and camaraderie.

Join us on this adventure as we unravel the mysteries of words, celebrate the Year of the Dragon, and indulge in the delightful experience of the Dragon Fruit Delight project!
